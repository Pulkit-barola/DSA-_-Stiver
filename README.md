# 🧠 DSA Learning Journey (Striver's DSA Sheet)

Welcome to my **DSA Learning Repository** — where I’m learning and practicing **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** following **Striver’s DSA Sheet**.  
This repository will track my daily progress, solutions, and understanding of core DSA topics using **C++**.

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Complete the full **Striver DSA Sheet**
- Strengthen fundamentals of **Data Structures & Algorithms**
- Write clean, efficient, and well-documented code
- Stay consistent and push progress to GitHub regularly


## 📘 Topics Covered (So Far)

* ✅ Arrays
* ✅ Binary Search
* ✅ Linked List
* 🔄 Hashing
* 🔄 Stack & Queue
* ⏳ Trees & Graphs
* ⏳ Dynamic Programming

*(Progress will update as I continue learning.)*



## ⚙️ Tools & Environment

* 💻 **Language:** C++
* 🧰 **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
* 🧾 **Compiler:** MinGW (g++)
* 🧠 **Source:** [Striver’s DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/)

## 🌟 Motivation

> “DSA is not about memorizing patterns — it’s about **understanding logic and building intuition.**”

I’m sharing my progress publicly to stay consistent and inspire others to learn alongside me 💪


🧩 *“Consistency + Curiosity = Mastery”*
Let’s ace DSA — one problem at a time 🚀
